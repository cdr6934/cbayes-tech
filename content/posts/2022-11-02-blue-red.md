How do we try to reimagine the next generation of our economy. 

## Historical context

Some of us are looking to the past and seeing the elements of Marx and Hegel to be the the reimagined shining light, the "heaven on earth"  . And the question we have to seriously need to consider is the historical dictatorships of Communist Russia and the 3rd Reich and now we have moved over to a new era where we have removed some of the Single Entity Economic model bringing on some of the free market economics



## Post capitalism 
I think we have seem something come to head, we see that the growth of Facebook, Google, Microsoft come to an apex. 



## Alternatives to a new economic age 
This could just be because I have been reading a whole lot of interesting material. The world has come to a head.. we are seeing that the likes of the bitcoin community see an alterative world where currency is empowered by the people vs the empowered by the state.
