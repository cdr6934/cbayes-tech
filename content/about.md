# Hi! My name is Chris Ried! 

I am a artist who loves to learn and who happens to use technology to mine it. I've spent much of the last 10 years exploring many different mediums and applications. 

As an artist, or creative technologist or whatever you might want to call it. 

My life's calling always has been to create, tinker, learn.. 

I love to explore for the sake of finding the small moments ["the glitch in the matrix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) or the "wrinkle in the fabric of time" to document the secrets of the universe that present themselves.
