Hello fellow readers, 

Hope your Friday morning / afternoon is going well. There are a number of interesting links below for you to digest and swallow. 

And for just a little inspirationâ€¦ 

If you havenâ€™t seen the work by [Tyler Boswell](https://www.teaboswell.com/)  definitely check out his work [September](https://www.teaboswell.com/projects/september)

## [Fifteen Ways to Draw a Line](https://sighack.com/post/fifteen-ways-to-draw-a-line)

> Early last year I challenged myself to come up withÂ [twenty five designs using only Perlin flow fields](https://sighack.com/post/getting-creative-with-perlin-noise-fields) and followed that up withÂ [seventy-five different ways to draw a circle](https://sighack.com/post/seventy-five-ways-to-draw-a-circle). In this article I explore another simple challenge: fifteen different ways to draw interesting lines.

If you are looking for a longer overview on how to use shaders on websites to create distortion effects this is a good sit down.

> Cassie Evans (from Greensock) chats to Jake about SVG paths, and what that mess of letters and numbers actually means.
> 

I thought this was a very helpful overview of SVG paths and how they work without going into the technical documentation. Plus its pretty entertaining.

# [Noise (12 Months of aRt)](https://www.williamrchase.com/post/noise-12-months-of-art-august/)

> I wonâ€™t pretend that I understand the math behind noise algorithms, but Iâ€™ll at least try to describe what some of our options are and how they can influence the output. Letâ€™s meet the players: noise generating algorithms include Perlin, OpenSimplex, Worley, Cubic, and more, and some of these include parameters than can be tweaked to change the values and appearance of the generated noise. Letâ€™s demonstrate using one-dimensional Perlin noiseâ€¦

 I wrote an edition of the newsletter highlighting some aRtists, but I will need to update [my article](https://generative.substack.com/p/generative-art-and-r) The noise article for August is an example of some of the great writing of William Chase on using R for generative art. Iâ€™d highly recommend checking some more of his work.

## Stop Writing Dead Programs

> Most new programming languages are accidentally designed to be backwards compatible with punchcards. This talk argues that it would be better to focus on building new live programming environments that can help us solve the problems of the future.
> 

Highly recommend listening to this.. there are some very interesting code visualization things that Jack refers to in his talk and I canâ€™t recommend enough to listen to it. Also, even if you donâ€™t listen itâ€™s worth going through his talk notes [here](https://jackrusher.com/strange-loop-2022/).

## ****[Diffuse Point Lighting](https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/modern-opengl/06-diffuse-point-lighting/)****

> This is the first article covering lighting. We will begin our lighting adventure by implementing per-pixel, diffuse lighting with a single point light. In later articles we will implement ambient and specular reflection, directional lights, spotlights, attenuation, and using multiple lights.

> Ross Lovegrove is an internationally renowned designer and visionary, whose works are celebrated as the new aesthetic expression of the twenty-first century. His industrial design is inspired by the logic and beauty of nature. It connects technology and innovative production methods with new materials and an intelligent, organic vocabulary of forms, in an inimitable way. By carefully selecting, combining, and composing these elements he succeeds in inventing a completely unique language of his own. A very human vision and a sustainable, inventive approach form the basis for all of his work.

There are many inspiring aspects in the work of Ross Lovegrove, but he speaks alot on evolutionary design and the intersects of technology and nature. Definitely check it out!
