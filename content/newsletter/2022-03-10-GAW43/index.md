> Practice any art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry, fiction, essays, reportage, no matter how well or badly, not to get money and fame, but to experience becoming, to find out what’s inside of you, to make your soul grow. Seriously! I mean starting right now, do art and do it for the rest of your lives. - Kurt Vonnegut

The quote above is so powerful that I really don’t think there is much more to be said. As we live in a time of uncertainty, I can’t think of any better use of time than taking care of our inner soul. 

So I’ll keep this brief...

# [Understanding Pattern Formation During Morphogenesis](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2012/morphogenesis/)

> As disordered as nature appears, a number of natural phenomena adhere to consistent patterns. One such phenomenon observed in nature is that of *phyllotaxis*, a term that refers to the arrangement of leaves around a stem.

# **[A Brief History of Generative Art](https://studioanf.com/a-brief-history-of-generative-art/)**

> Computer art is an art form in which computers play a role in the process or final product, such as display of artwork. Generative art is at the same time more specific and more encompassing than computer art. Generative art refers to art that in whole or part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. The autonomous system can be a computer, but more broadly an autonomous system is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions to be made directly by an artist. In many cases, the artist, or human creator, can claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea. There are, however, cases in which the system takes on the role of creator entirely.
