> It is a commonplace among artists and children at play that they're not aware of time or solitude while they're chasing their vision. The hours fly. - Steven Pressfield
> 

I’ve been  reading the book “[The War of Art”](https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/) by Steven Pressfield and have found a number of quotes that have resonated with me quite a bit over the last year. Specifically when it comes to knowing how to simple continue. Creativity and its call can be such a driving force…. 

> Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.
> 

But there is are a number of opportunities that come up and they all start coming together and finding oneself in a crux. 

> Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce.
> 

Especially when you are so close to finishing some projects and then having to take them across the finish line… 

> The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. At this point, Resistance knows we're about to beat it. It hits the panic button. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it's got.
> 

But the worst thing about putting art there is this resistance. 

> Resistance is not out to get you personally. It doesn't know who you are and doesn't care. Resistance is a force of nature. It acts objectively. Though it feels malevolent, Resistance in fact operates with the indifference of rain and transits the heavens by the same laws as the stars. When we marshal our forces to combat Resistance, we must remember this.

Much of his writing has been useful to take in chunks this week and think about and these have been definitely helpful to reframe my thoughts as an artist. 

Hope you all can glean something from these thoughts as I have.. 

Have a wonderful week!

P.S. 

**A few inspirations from the week:** 

 you haven’t see the work of Anna Lucia, here is just a wonderful wonderful piece that is simple yet complicated.

You can check out here work [here](https://y.at/%F0%9F%8E%B2%F0%9F%96%BC%F0%9F%92%BE%F0%9F%90%89)…

And as always, but particularly of late [Zach Liebermann’s](https://twitter.com/zachlieberman) work has been so intricately laced… its crazy.

## [Between Poetry and Painting](https://archive.org/details/xfoml0003/page/n11/mode/2up)

> The work presented in this exhibition crosses the frontier between two quite clearly defined fields of creative activity - poetry and painting. There may be no single accurate definition of this hybrid form of expression - one thing is quite clear, nevertheless - visual poetry is its various forms constitutes the first international poetry movement.

The book was written / compiled by [Jasia Reichardt](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Jasia+Reichardt%22) and the book is such and inspirational pieces to browse and even think about putting together .

> The uniqueness of the infinite cluster is known for the d-dimenional lattice since the works of Aizenman, Kesten and Newman - [Uniqueness of the infinite cluster and continuity of connectivity functions for short and long range percolation (1987)] and Burton and Keane - [Density and uniqueness in percolation (1989)]. It does not hold in general: when the graph in question is a regular tree for example, there are always infinitely many clusters during the supercritical phase.

## [CLIP-based Neural Neighbor Style Transfer for 3D Assets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04370.pdf)

> We present a method for transferring the style from a set of images to a 3D object. The texture appearance of an asset is optimized with a differentiable renderer in a pipeline based on losses using pretrained deep neural networks. More specifically, we utilize a nearest-neighbor feature matching loss with CLIP-ResNet50 to extract the style from images. We show that a CLIP based style loss provides a different appearance over a VGG-based loss by focusing more on texture over geometric shapes. Additionally, we extend the loss to support multiple images and enable loss-based control over the color palette combined with
automatic color palette extraction from style images.

## ****[Diffusion Bee - Stable Diffusion GUI App for M1 Mac](https://github.com/divamgupta/diffusionbee-stable-diffusion-ui)****

> Diffusion Bee is the easiest way to run Stable Diffusion locally on your M1 Mac. Comes with a one-click installer. No dependencies or technical knowledge needed.

If you haven’t had the opportunity on [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/auth/signin/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) or [DALLE2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and want to try it on your own machine without having to do all of the “coding” setup here. This Diffusion Bee UI really was an easy way to try it out. The above images all came from my local implementation!

Unfortunately you will need to have PhasePlant in order to do the following. However, as I love sound design and music generation, Dash Glitch does such a fine job at explaining how he uses PhasePlant to create generative music. The remap plugin is a very important use in generative art as well as you remap from one range to another.
