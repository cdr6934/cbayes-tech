Well its been a little over a month since the last newsletter has gone out.  There are just too many things to get done in a day. 

Also, I have been working at making the links from the last 40+ newsletters in one place so that they are more accessible. Right now they are just a [Markdown page](https://github.com/cdr6934/GenerativeArtsNewsletter/blob/main/IssueLinks.md) but hopefully will give this a little more structure as well.

# The Weird and Wonderful World of AI Art

> The world of Artificial-Intelligence generated art has exploded over the last twelve months. In January 2021, OpenAI released two models that changed the game: DALL-E and CLIP. These models showed what might be possible by generating visual art from text-based prompts. The release of DALL-E and CLIP kickstarted a new wave of work in AI art. Digital artists organized on Twitter, Github, and Discord developed tools for prototyping and generating art. For the technically proficient, artists shared their work in the form of Colab notebooks. For those without coding skills, art can be created through new websites and tools that allow you to harness the power of these deep learning models without writing any code.

# 📸 Generative Music

{{ youtube S2EZqikCIfY }}

> In this film, we meet a community of artists who are harnessing algorithms to make live and improvised electronic music. "If music is a form of code, then perhaps code can be a form of music." Algorithms drive the way we see, hear and interact with the world. And these days, there's a growing backlash against them. But "algorave"—short for algorithmic rave—offers a different way to harness these mathematical formulas. Algorave artists sit behind a laptop while their keystrokes are broadcast onto screens or walls around them, laying bare the mechanics behind the music. They run processes that create the sound in realtime, allowing for a truly live, improvisational and unpredictable form of electronic music.

# Yorkshire Sound Woman Network

> On December 5th 2015 Joanne Armitage and Shelly Knotts delivered a workshop on live coding for Algoraving. Watch the film to find out more, and also to discover why this was an all-women workshop. The event was hosted by The Yorkshire Sound Women Network and funded generously by the AHRC Live Coding Research Network. Facilitated by The University of Huddersfield department of Music and Drama.

# [Dreaming Shapes](https://observablehq.com/d/6c9ec5079d2702ec)

> My attempt in replicating [Inconvergent’s](http://inconvergent.net/) ever so beautiful [works on depth of field (DOF)](https://inconvergent.net/2019/depth-of-field/). His article explains how to take a point in 3D space and apply *a faux depth of field* effect.

I’m not using WebGL. The graphics is using only 2D canvas.

The shapes (lines, squares, or triangles) are created within a 3D space with random rotations. Then, each edges of the shapes are interpolated into points. DOF is applied on each of these points, resulting in more points. These points are drawn on to the canvas using colour with some alpha value and random pixel size.

## **[Molecular Nodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes)**

> Molecular Nodes provides a convenient method for importing structural biology files into Blender, and several nodes for working with atomic data inside of Blender's Geometry Nodes.

Blender's Geometry Nodes provides a powerful interface for procedural modelling and animation. Currently it is limited in its ability to read any kind of structured data file as input, that isn't a 3D mesh. Molecular Nodes bridges this gap by providing an interface for converting `.pdb` and other file types into meshes that are usable by Geometry Nodes.

# [An Algorithm for Irregular Grids](https://gorillasun.de/blog/an-algorithm-for-irregular-grids)

> Grids, in their various shapes and forms, have been an important backbone for my sketches since I started creative coding. I’d go as far as saying that grids are a prominent generative art archetype that sits at the foundation of many works. Two influential examples from an early generative art period would be Georg Nees’ 1968 work Schotter (german word for Gravel) and Vera Molnár’s 1974 artwork (Dés)Ordres (french word for (dis)order):

## [TactileJS](https://github.com/isohedral/tactile-js)

TactileJS is a Javascript library for representing, manipulating, and drawing tilings of the plane. The tilings all belong to a special class called the *isohedral tilings*. Every isohedral tiling is formed from repeated copies of a single shape, and the pattern of repetition is fairly simple. At the same time, isohedral tilings are very expressive (they form the basis for a lot of the tessellations created by M.C. Escher) and efficient to compute.

The engine is in its early days, but as you see there are some very interesting and has the node style of work.

[Palett.es](http://Palett.es) is a really neat way to create colors that can be used in various cases. For me, I love using tools like this as I explore color variations. Some do it with paints, some in procreate and then some will use tools such as this.
