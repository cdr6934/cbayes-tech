Good morning friends! 

I want to thank you for your continued support! 

I want to make a few points on reading deeply and how it might relate in creative coding / generative art. We have past the apex of popularity when it comes to generative art. It will be a fascinating era of history in the future that will bring some interesting insights into understanding creativity and market forces.

That being said, a few points on how we can continue to nurture the legacy and interest. Yes, large numbers and big sales are definitely an aspect and the art world provides good evidence for that. But what about the details..

## Provides context

Without a good understanding, it is difficult to know what has been done and what can be done. I often reflect on the [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) era of the late 1990s and early 2000s and marvel at the incredible work that resulted from simply tinkering with new tools.

Twenty-ish years later, Processing/Javascript has taken Flash's place, and we see many derivative works and facsimiles from the Web 1.0/2.0 era.  While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, failing to understand the context only presents a muted version of the vibrant picture that history can provide.

## Adds depth and perspective

Again, without appreciation and understanding, life can feel like reliving the same day over and over again. The same patterns repeat themselves, leaving nothing new or interesting to explore. It's like listening to classical music for the average American – the same instruments, the same beat and structure. Without a deeper understanding of the timing, musical motifs, and structure, there isn't much difference.

> However, understanding what has been done and why it was done can help guide further exploration and discovery.
> 

## Paves a future

Deep understand of context and perspective become the guiding light in how to appreciate which leads to further explore beyond what has been done. 

- Its spelunking in a cave that has yet to be discovered.
- It’s being able to see beyond the visible spectrum and providing points of exploration.

Just like [Vera Molnar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r) or [Manfred Mohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Mohr) and the onset of the computer of the 60s. Or the [Duchamp’s fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)) of being able to challenge the status quo of what is art. 

## Who made me?

**Manfred Mohr -P1011_MS, 2004 (***The Algorithmic Dimension, ́ Springer ́ Series ́ on ́ Cultural ́ Computing, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61167-9_5 ́*)

**Manfred Mohr** is a pioneering figure in the field of digital art, recognized for his algorithmically generated works that utilize the aesthetics of the cube. Born in Germany in 1938, Mohr began his career as an action painter and jazz musician before turning his attention to computer-generated art in the late 1960s. He often uses computer algorithms to transform the multidimensional properties of a cube into two-dimensional visual experiences. His innovative work has been exhibited in prominent institutions worldwide, and he was the first artist to ever have a solo exhibition of computer-generated artwork, held at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1971. In his work, Mohr marries the seemingly disparate worlds of art and technology, creating a visual language that challenges and redefines traditional notions of art.

## [Scripting RiTa](https://observablehq.com/@dhowe/riscript) (Generative Language)

> A tutorial on [RiScript](https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/riscript.html), the writer-oriented scripting language included with [RiTa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rita). RiScript expressions, described below, can be included in any RiTa [grammar](https://rednoise.org/rita/tutorials/grammars.html), or run directly via [RiTa.evaluate()](https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/evaluate/).

This is an Observable notebook. RiTa is a more “composable” alternative to generative writing than the large language models (aka ChatGPT). This library is more heuristic in nature, however doesn’t require an API.

## ****[Searching for rigidity in algebraic starscapes](https://doi-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/10.1080/17513472.2022.2045048)****

> We create plots of algebraic integers in the complex plane, exploring the effect of sizing the points according to various arithmetic invariants. We focus on Galois theoretic invariants, in particular creating plots which emphasize algebraic integers whose Galois group is *not* the full symmetric group−these integers we call *rigid*. We then give some analysis of the resulting images, suggesting avenues for future research about the geometry of so-called *rigid algebraic integers*.

> An observable notebook created by [Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock) and inspired by the work of Dave Whyte of [beesbombs](https://www.instagram.com/davebeesbombs/). It’s not a tutorial, but more of a code inspiration on how Mike uses D3.geo, package, Plot on the Observable platform. I’ve been mesmerized by  his work for a number of years and always find enjoyment in the simple looping animations Dave has been making.

## ****[Modeling 3D Patterns with Rhino Grasshopper](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/4399-modeling-3d-patterns-with-rhino-grasshopper)****

> Algorithms are the language of modern-day society. According to architect and computational designer Arturo Tedeschi, the idea of "conceiving, designing, and creating through algorithms means entering a dimension where the physical limits imposed by a pen or mouse no longer exist." In this online course, he teaches you to speak this contemporary language by introducing you to **3D modeling with Grasshopper for Rhino**.
