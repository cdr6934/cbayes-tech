> "Creativity is the brain's invisible muscle -- that when used and excercised routinely -- becomes better and stronger." - **Ashley Ormon**

This is an abbreviated version of the newsletter to update last week. Due to the holidays, I haven't finished the output in time for you to enjoy. But we will be back to normal next week. 

But first, we have an announcement.... 🥁

**We have a winner!!!**

Daryl from Manitoba has won the giveaway! I'll have it out in the mail at some point next week!  Thank you all who participated and I hope that we will be able to do this at some point again in the future!  

Also if you are looking to challenge yourself by "sketching" daily, please participate and tag yourself with #genuary, #genuary2021 and if you want me to tag you, use #generatecollective!

## Interactive Flowers Projection with ParticleSOP

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADtM2_awSj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADtM2_awSj8)

> Akiko will present her most recent work 'Hana Fubuki', an interactive flowers projection for Artechouse DC. The presentation will cover both artistic and technical aspects of creating an art installation. From concept and prototyping to pre-visualizing the project using using TouchDesigner, Akiko will discuss the technical requirements of the project; setting up multiple Kinect devices with small computers across a network; NDI quality and resolution tips; how the project was driven using a Particle SOP with Force and Metaball SOP; creating custom attributes and geometry instancing with w coordinate with Texture 3D TOP will all be discussed.

A simple and inspiring technical talk.

## [So You Want to Build a Generator](http://www.galaxykate.com/blog/generator.html)

> This is a beginner-level advice essay for people just getting started with building generators. It's also for practiced experts who want a way to organize their knowledge. The advice is meant for any kind of generators: humorous twitterbots, fanciful art-making bots, level generators, planet builders, makers of music, architecture, poetry, and cocktails. (edit: it turned out to be 4000 words long, so enjoy the ride!)

## [Bethlehem stars: classifying randomly generated mandalas](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2143094?fbclid=IwAR1J-q7reZI7A8dHtG2bZTOujZmnyYKQTw5zeBhCdCHrtFhOdis9dqKBV7M)

> This document/notebook is inspired by the Mathematica Stack Exchange (MSE) question "Plotting the Star of Bethlehem", [MSE1]. That MSE question requests efficient and fast plotting of a certain mathematical function that (maybe) looks like the Star of Bethlehem, [Wk1]. Instead of doing what the author of the questions suggests, I decided to use a generative art program and workflows from three of most important Machine Learning (ML) sub-cultures: Latent Semantic Analysis, Recommendations, and Classification.

## AAD Algorithms-Aided Design: Parametric Strategies

> Algorithmic design is not simply the use of computer to design architecture and objects. Algorithms allow designers to overcome the limitations of traditional CAD software and 3D modelers, reaching a level of complexity and control which is beyond the human manual ability. Algorithms-Aided Design presents design methods based on the use of Grasshopper (R), a visual algorithm editor tightly integrated with Rhinoceros (R), the 3D modeling software by McNeel & Associates allowing users to explore accurate freeform shapes. The book provides computational techniques to develop and control complex geometries, covering parametric modeling, digital fabrication techniques, form-finding strategies, environmental analysis and structural optimization. It also features case studies and contributions by researchers and designers from world's most influential universities and leading architecture firms.

This book I received as a present over the holidays and I am quite excited to continue to learn from it and the techniques that are used. Ultimately I'd like to incorporate some of them into the work. 

This doesn't necessarily fall into the category of pure generative art. However many of the algorithms used to generate some of the beautiful pieces that you might find are inspired by them or continue to provide the same nature.

# Software Libraries

 I haven't done this yet; however I find that it is always important to see what has already been created. For one, you don't want to have to reinvent the wheel (except for learning an algorithm). That way it gives you even more time to create more intricate mechanisms. 

# Processing

## Lunar

> Lunar is a lightweight parametric design library for the minimalist, inspired on existing node-based plug-ins for CAD software. She holds algorithms for the easy generation and adaptation of polygon meshes, vectors and list patterns. She has a built-in interactive camera and additional renderer extensions.
