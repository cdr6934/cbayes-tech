Let‚Äôs not forget what makes art and the aesthetic beautiful. the process and the relationship one has with a piece of art.\nYou might say, GANs can‚Äôt really be considered autonomous art since a training set has been use to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù the style of the system of images. And I agree! However, there are two things I‚Äôd consider with that statement.\nFirst, what am I but a database of many inspirations from which I pull that create ideas. We are essentially a neural engine whose stored inspiration has 1000‚Äôs of models in place which end up becoming our intuition. So in one sense, there isn‚Äôt a true ‚Äúgenuine inspiration.‚Äù We are constrained to our reality and what we experience. Outside of that, the unknown is but a blank slate.\nWe don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶\nAlso, we need to remember that there will be a point in which enough GANs will be created and then we will start seeing ensemble GANs which will learn from each other creating larger weights that could very well learn or at least mimic inspiration.\nI would liken it to the 7 archetypes of story telling. A compelling story will have certain characteristics on which all stories are based. Yes, there is a combinatorial factor that almost leads to infinite combinations to create such a story which is great.\nBut what if, there is a pattern out there in what makes great art that our meat computers can‚Äôt compute, but silicon can?\nWe know it can generate the work with human intervention. if you haven‚Äôt seen the CG that is created in movies these days such as the CG model of Peter Cushing in the last two episodes of Star Wars.\nWe know that it is likely our computers will be able to generate models that can take on any style or characteristic at some point very soon.\nComputation will continue to become more advanced and will have a better understanding of the world simply due to the shifting understanding of computation. It can sift through a ton of data and generate its own intuition quicker than our meat calculators are able.\nAn example of this, I think one of the interesting projects currently going on at Wolfram (creators of Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language) is the physics project in which they are searching for a more complete representation of our universe using more of a computational method vs the classical physics approaches to create a language of a more complete system of physics. Computation, will slowly take the rigour of mathematics and redefines some of the ways in which things are understood and calculated.\nAt this point, it may sound a little cold. Computers will rule the earth! But we are far off from that at this point, it could go really quick (i.e. a couple years) or it can take decades and centuries till we have made the progress needed to get there.\nThe limiting factors are:\nour reaction toward the technology (think luddite) technical skill / motivation / innovation (when things are too good, we sometimes just take the easy road) (i.e. look at global warming pushback) letting our animal instincts take over and ruin ourselves ( based on history, is probably the more likely scenario) fear But eventually, unless science brings a curve ball into the mix (which it always does to an extent) we will see autonomous art become a reality.\nSo let‚Äôs keep on working on simple skills. A brush, a pen, are amazing pieces of technology that continue to inspire even today as we generate visuals that make us think.\nBtw, if you haven‚Äôt watch Blown Away on Netflix, please do. Talk about a beautiful ‚Äúphysical‚Äù art form that gives me so many chills. Glass is such a beautiful material to see it being shaped into many fantastic pieces. ..

It‚Äôs one of the first digital morphogenesis algorithm that became well known and toyed with by geeky fractal digital artists in the 90‚Äôs as computers then had just enough power to start simulating Brownian Motion.\nüèõÔ∏è Exhibits / Installations Generative Photography: An Interview of Gottfried Jager As the photographic industry was the refuge of every would-be painter, every painter too ill-endowed or too lazy to complete his studies, this universal infatuation bore not only the mark of a blindness, an imbecility, but had also the air of a vengeance. I do not believe, or at least I do not wish to believe, in the absolute success of such a brutish conspiracy, in which, as in all others, one finds both fools and knaves; but I am convinced that the ill-applied developments of photography, like all other purely material developments of progress, have contrib¬≠uted much to the impoverishment of the French artistic genius, which is already so scarce.\nüö§ Motion {{ youtube J-0NzU1TmIY }}\nTissue - Experimenting with the Reaction-Diffusion Some quick experiments with the updated Reaction-Diffusion simulation using the Tissue add-on.\nBlender, an open source 3D animation software package akin to 3D Max, Maya, and others will be a good learn If you have any interest in 3D animation. I‚Äôve done some work in it out of curiousity and found this plugin which was used in the previous reaction diffusion tutorial is a serious look into.\n{{ youtube 2Wcu9E0EGEM }}\nüîñ Articles and Tutorials Quantum Computer Meets Pen Plotter This is what I like the most about quantum computing. I love the analogue and fallible nature. A quantum computer is like tricking the fundamental building blocks of nature into doing a computation, and despite our best efforts, we will never be in complete control. There are theories and methods to mitigate noise, but regardless, probability and interference are fundamentally a part of quantum mechanics. And for near-term quantum devices, working with the noise is an unavoidable part of the process.\nhttps://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1602427551578-RGA97QEDFNEKV3M6AWEA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kO8_YboCv19fRznh15ozlhJ7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UQ42Tz7kAiUMG67ch55OKLcMN3S8lorKDFyYZT8h6l537zs2yPjc1ECvpa5Zm_kMqw/Cross+Hatch+Automata\nInterview w/ Generative Artist Kjetil Golid All communities have identities built around core principles. I‚Äôve learned over the last few years that the traditional art world tends to value, promote, and embrace scarcity, and as a result, often finds that there are not enough resources to go around. It is noteworthy to me that communities that promote abundance, sharing, and generosity, such as the generative art community, often find that they have all of the resources and support that they need and more.\nThe fractal nature of almost all things Here‚Äôs a short activity: take a bowlful of dried rice, or, if your environment allows, sand. Pour it slowly onto the same spot. Watch as it builds into a pyramid. Continue to watch as the sides of that pyramid begin to avalanche. Notice how these avalanches continue to occur at the same frequency while you continue to pour.\nA Primer on B√©zier Curves This is a free website/ebook dealing with both the maths and programming aspects of Bezier Curves, covering a wide range of topics relating to drawing and working with that curve that seems to pop up everywhere, from Photoshop paths to CSS easing functions to Font outline descriptions.\nCourses Musicspace: Getting Started with Max The monthly workshops will have 4 sessions of 2 hours each. Participants will learn how to get started with interactive audio and MIDI, and discover the possibilities of the Max environment. They will learn how to manipulate audio, MIDI, virtual instruments, and program their own interactive canvas, and will learn from guided examples and live interactions with teachers and other participants.\nBooks Fundamentals of Data Visualization The book is meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. It has grown out of my experience of working with students and postdocs in my laboratory on thousands of data visualizations. Over the years, I have noticed that the same issues arise over and over. I have attempted to collect my accumulated knowledge from these interactions in the form of this book.\nSend me your inspirations‚Ä¶ You can also find me at:\n","wordCount":"1461","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-02-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-02-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chris Ried"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://generativecollective.com/newsletter/generative-arts-17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Artistic Portfolio of Chris Ried","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://generativecollective.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://generativecollective.com/ accesskey=h title="Chris Ried (Alt + H)"><img src=https://generativecollective.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Chris Ried</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/resources/ title=Resources><span>Resources</span></a></li><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/writings/ title=Writings><span>Writings</span></a></li><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/newsletter/ title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/resume/ title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://generativecollective.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://generativecollective.com/newsletter/>Newsletters</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Autonomous Artistry and the Physical</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-02-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 20, 2021</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;1461 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Chris Ried&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/cdr6934/content/newsletter/2021-02-20-GAW17/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#dmitri-cherniak---ringers>Dmitri Cherniak -
