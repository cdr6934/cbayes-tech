Reas is a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He holds a master‚Äôs degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Media Arts and Sciences and a bachelor‚Äôs degree from the College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning at the University of Cincinnati.

Diagonal paths are all the combinatorial possibilities of connecting two opposite points through a hypercube network, passing through each dimension once.\nInspired by his exploration of a ‚Äúsurrealistic geometry‚Äù in the mid-1960s, which consisted of exploring the tension fields created by the voids between geometric elements in visual composition, Mohr develops the same principle in this series through an algorithm. Here, two randomly selected and superimposed 11-dimensional diagonal paths describe white and black forms, projected on a colored background. At times, the black form interchanges its color with the background to further create new visual relations in form and tension fields.\n{{ youtube yEZynnxWd2I }}\nThis is an ecosystem of interdependent creatures coded in p5js. There is a set of rules for the movement of each type of creature, implemented using physics simulations. These rules are simple but, when combined, produce interesting behaviours in a complex system.\nThe creatures move around the canvas with flocking behaviours which mimic flocks of birds or schools of fish. They also have their own independent ‚Äúwiggle‚Äù, and are attracted to the centre of the frame. The particles are attracted to their original position, but repelled by the creatures. To add realism and nuance to the results, the size and colours of the creatures and particles are also given variety.\nüèõÔ∏è Exhibits / Installations https://vimeo.com/471005339\nAn undulating kinetic artwork by Scale Collective blends organic movement and architectural forms in a mesmerizing installation. Created for the Constellations Festival in Metz, France, ‚ÄúFlux‚Äù is comprised of 48 beams of light that stretch 1.5-meters-long and are spaced 40 centimeters apart. Each is connected to a single mechanism that‚Äôs motorized and controlled by viewers through an interface, allowing for a synchronized performance of twisting and coiling patterns. ‚ÄúThe formal multiplication of these lines coupled with micro variations of phases, time delays, speeds, and amplitudes allows us to sculpt an object 20 meters long, alive and evolving with a cyclical back and forth movement,‚Äù the French collective says.

Over the last 50 years, our world has turned digital at breakneck speed. No art form has captured this transitional time period - our time period - better than generative art. Generative art takes full advantage of everything that computing has to offer, producing elegant and compelling artworks that extend the same principles and goals artists have pursued from the inception of modern art.\nOn Generative Poetry: Structural, Stylistic and Lexical Features This paper deals with key aspects of the Oulipo and Dada methods and their implementation in electronic generative poetry. Oulipian constraints such as acrostics, tautograms, simple numerical limitations and combinatory algorithms are easily integrated into digital environments. The analysis of structural, lexical and stylistic peculiarities of generative poetry is illustrated by permutational schemes (Poem.exe by Liam Cooke, Book of all Words by J√≥zef ZÃáuk Piwkowski), combinatory patterns (Frequency by Scott Rettberg) and syntactic templates (Dizains by Marcel B√©nabou, Triolets by Paul Braffort) of electronic poems. Many combinatory and permutational electronic poems present technologically improved versions of the Oulipo constraints and Dada techniques such as open-form poetry and the use of image and graphic components in its structure. However, the electronic environment gives them an ambivalent status. Although the surface of an electronic poem looks open and random, its inward structure is preconfigured to use established parameters.\nTo note: Dada - everyday objects that could be bought and presented as art with little manipulation by the artist. The use of the readymade forced questions about artistic creativity and the very definition of art and its purpose in society.\nOuilipo - a loose gathering of (mainly) French-speaking writers and mathematicians who seek to create works using constrained writing techniques. I\nDextro, One Of The Most Elusive Algorithmic Artists Since the mid-90s, the hermetic and anonymous artist behind the name Dextro has been quietly creating some of the most pioneering algorithmic and generative art. Though his identity is a mystery, he is known for converging various styles, with work resembling luminous waves in one piece, and glitchy patterns in the next.\nFascinating article of an artist I had not heard of until just recently so I hope you enjoy his work!\n{{ youtube U3cTXqvW3XU }}\nArchimedian Solid The Archimedean solids are distinguished by having very high symmetry, thus excluding solids belonging to a dihedral group of symmetries (e.g., the two infinite families of regular prisms and antiprisms), as well as the elongated square gyrobicupola (because that surface‚Äôs symmetry-breaking twist allows vertices ‚Äúnear the equator‚Äù and those ‚Äúin the polar regions‚Äù to be distinguished; Cromwell 1997, p. 92). The Archimedean solids are sometimes also referred to as the semiregular polyhedra.\nVisual Depth Cues In a recent discussion with Louis-Andr√© Labadie the subject of ‚Äúatmospheric perspective‚Äù came up. After trying out various rendering techniques, I was surprised with the effectiveness of this depth cue. I knew of a couple of other depth cues (the most obvious ones being perspective and shading), but I wondered if I knew all of them, and whether there would be any surprising ones, or ones that I might have been neglecting in my art. So I did a little research.\nBooks Generative modeling is one of the hottest topics in AI. It‚Äôs now possible to teach a machine to excel at human endeavors such as painting, writing, and composing music. With this practical book, machine-learning engineers and data scientists will discover how to re-create some of the most impressive examples of generative deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks (GANs), encoder-decoder models, and world models.\nSend me your inspirations‚Ä¶

Generative art takes full advantage of everything that computing has to offer, producing elegant and compelling artworks that extend the same principles and goals artists have pursued from the inception of modern art.</p></blockquote><p><img loading=lazy src=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be28f0a2-14ab-41f3-adba-4f2cbfd2de71/Screen_Capture_-_Apr_11__3_04_PM.png alt=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be28f0a2-14ab-41f3-adba-4f2cbfd2de71/Screen_Capture_-_Apr_11__3_04_PM.png></p><h2 id=on-generative-poetry-structural-stylistic-and-lexical-featureshttpswwwresearchgatenetpublication328475675_on_generative_poetry_structural_stylistic_and_lexical_features><a href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328475675_On_Generative_Poetry_Structural_Stylistic_and_Lexical_Features>On Generative Poetry: Structural, Stylistic and Lexical Features</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#on-generative-poetry-structural-stylistic-and-lexical-featureshttpswwwresearchgatenetpublication328475675_on_generative_poetry_structural_stylistic_and_lexical_features>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>This paper deals with key aspects of the Oulipo and Dada methods and their
implementation in electronic generative poetry. Oulipian constraints such as
acrostics, tautograms, simple numerical limitations and combinatory algorithms are easily integrated into digital environments. The analysis of structural, lexical and stylistic peculiarities of generative poetry is illustrated by permutational schemes (Poem.exe by Liam Cooke, Book of all Words by J√≥zef ZÃáuk Piwkowski), combinatory patterns (Frequency by Scott Rettberg) and syntactic templates (Dizains by Marcel B√©nabou, Triolets by Paul Braffort) of electronic poems. Many combinatory and permutational electronic poems present technologically improved versions of the Oulipo constraints and Dada techniques such as open-form poetry and the use of image and graphic components in its structure. However, the electronic environment gives them an ambivalent status. Although the surface of an electronic poem looks open and random, its inward structure is preconfigured to use established parameters.</p></blockquote><h3 id=to-note>To note:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#to-note>#</a></h3><p><strong>Dada</strong> - everyday objects that could be bought and presented as art with little manipulation by the artist.

The Archimedean solids are sometimes also referred to as the semiregular polyhedra.</p></blockquote><h2 id=visual-depth-cueshttpspiterpasmanlarticlesdepth-cues><a href=https://piterpasma.nl/articles/depth-cues>Visual Depth Cues</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#visual-depth-cueshttpspiterpasmanlarticlesdepth-cues>#</a></h2><p><img loading=lazy src=https://piterpasma.nl/articles/depth-cues1.jpg alt=https://piterpasma.nl/articles/depth-cues1.jpg></p><blockquote><p>In a recent discussion with Louis-Andr√© Labadie the subject of ‚Äúatmospheric perspective‚Äù came up. After trying out various rendering techniques, I was surprised with the effectiveness of this depth cue. I knew of a couple of other depth cues (the most obvious ones being perspective and shading), but I wondered if I knew all of them, and whether there would be any surprising ones, or ones that I might have been neglecting in my art.
