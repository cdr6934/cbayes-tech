This post is focused on the¬†visually pleasing¬†application¬†of these algorithms for procedural 3D geometry,¬†and it is not focused on using all the correct scientific terminology. So, disclaimer, maybe don‚Äôt try to base your Stanford 3D graphics paper on this blog post. But DO use it to get better acquainted with procedural geometry, make cool shapes, and have fun!\nImplementing cosine in C from scratch Have you ever wondered how the math library in your favorite programming language implements trigonometric functions, like cosine? It is such a common function that you can find in any and every math library so it must be fairly straight forward, right? Oh no. It most definitely is not.\nIts a bit more of a technical article but nonetheless interesting on the exact methodologies that Cosine has been coded in C\nSelf Generative Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oaf13T-3Gg\nSelf-generative music is music that is generated by a system, a computer, using MIDI information. In today‚Äôs video, we are going to use Ableton Live midi devices to create an endless combination of melodic information that will be repeated to infinity, creating different chapters of music one after another.The instrument I‚Äôm going to use for this demonstration is all by Spitfire Audio LABS, a free collection of around 40 plugins that have strong cinematic feels, guitar, piano, pads, cello, strings, and so on‚Ä¶..\nI‚Äôm always a bit of a sucker for the beauty that can come with modular synths and something like these wonderful instrumentals. Its definitely a skill one has to learn to do properly but there is something beautiful about the ethereal textures.\nüî®Tools GLSL Textures for Blender Create textures from GLSL fragment shaders on Blender 2.8+\nüìöBooks Anni and Josef Albers: Equal and Unequal Josef - painter, designer, and teacher - and Anni Albers - textile artist and printmaker - are among the twentieth century‚Äôs most important abstract artists, and this is the first monograph to celebrate the rich creative output and beguiling relationship of these two masters in one elegant volume. It presents their life and work as never before, from their formative years at the Bauhaus in Germany to their remarkable influence at Black Mountain College in the United States through their intensely productive period in Connecticut.\nThere is so much inspiration and beautiful history behind the relationship and artwork of Anni and Josef Albers. If you have the time to find a copy I‚Äôd definitely recommend taking an entire afternoon and really mulling over their work and contributions.\nSend me your inspirations‚Ä¶

It is such a common function that you can find in any and every math library so it must be fairly straight forward, right? Oh no. It most definitely is not.</p></blockquote><p>Its a bit more of a technical article but nonetheless interesting on the exact methodologies that Cosine has been coded in C</p><h2 id=self-generative-music>Self Generative Music<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#self-generative-music>#</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oaf13T-3Gg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oaf13T-3Gg</a></p><blockquote><p>Self-generative music is music that is generated by a system, a computer, using MIDI information. In today‚Äôs video, we are going to use Ableton Live midi devices to create an endless combination of melodic information that will be repeated to infinity, creating different chapters of music one after another.The instrument I&rsquo;m going to use for this demonstration is all by Spitfire Audio LABS, a free collection of around 40 plugins that have strong cinematic feels, guitar, piano, pads, cello, strings, and so on‚Ä¶..</p></blockquote><p>I‚Äôm always a bit of a sucker for the beauty that can come with modular synths and something like these wonderful instrumentals.

It presents their life and work as never before, from their formative years at the Bauhaus in Germany to their remarkable influence at Black Mountain College in the United States through their intensely productive period in Connecticut.</p></blockquote><p>There is so much inspiration and beautiful history behind the relationship and artwork of Anni and Josef Albers.
