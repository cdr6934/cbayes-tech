Read deeply. Stay open. Continue to wonder. -Austin Kleon
Good morning friends!
I want to thank you for your continued support!
I want to make a few points on reading deeply and how it might relate in creative coding / generative art. We have past the apex of popularity when it comes to generative art. It will be a fascinating era of history in the future that will bring some interesting insights into understanding creativity and market forces.</description>

I had no idea how creative ambition and life balance could coexist, because achieving balance seemed to imply being content, and didn&amp;rsquo;t contentment mean you were no longer hungry&amp;quot;? And if you lost your hunger, didn&amp;rsquo;t you one day wake up in the suburbs helicopter parenting a couple of kids or working at a soul sucking corporate job? You stopped making art. You stopped being passionate. You stopped being you.</description>

Good Morning!
I&amp;rsquo;ve found that this is the best way for me to get inspiration. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much time as I&amp;rsquo;d like, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s all about finding balance. When I was a full-time artist, I had a difficult time with this, but when I have other things in my life that help drive me, that&amp;rsquo;s when I&amp;rsquo;m at my best.</description>

Happy Holidays!
I hope you find time to appreciate the little things in life.
It is a time of stress, family, loneliness, and remembering those we lost.
So be kind to yourself, and find ways to appreciate the chaos..
May that be a little piece of code to obsess about, a quote to ponder, a walk in nature to absorb the color, smells, emotions, or simply the sound of the cold wind tickling your inner ear.</description>

Generative art can be done in almost every application. You will find that it can be done in Photoshop, using code, using simply code in the browser, or just by hand as one of my fellow generative artists (Dan Gries) has done.</description>

Good Evening Folks or Happy Friday!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on multiple small projects and this above was supposed to be a simple infographic of the most popular frameworks. However it has become an all weekend event on Twitter which was a great community effort. Being that there has been so much interest, I though this will be a great opportunity to move the wireframe version above into an interactive graph which I do look forward to finishing.</description>

The function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your artwork that soars. One of the basic and difficult lessons every artist must learn is that even the failed pieces are essential.</description>

What makes a good generative agent? It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting question, that I will scratch but the surface. However, I’ve gathered a list of general considerations from my observations of the generative arts. My intent is to discover and explore.
Some of this comes from the pursuit of understanding… in an ironic way. For one, It is the pursuit which help build an eye for the different, and aesthetically pleasing.</description>

I love the fact that the non-centralized infrastructure brings transparency to the masses. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea that we could be speeding up the process of CO2 shot into the environment due to additional electrical consumption of the blockchains.</description>

Good Morning!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering, &amp;ldquo;What is creativity and where does it come from?&amp;rdquo; Are we wired with certain default, &amp;ldquo;inspirations&amp;rdquo; of ideas that generate the corpus we have come up with today? I think of Carl Jung&amp;rsquo;s story archetypes and it would seem that there is evidence for a collective conscience.
Yet, we still need to ask, are there entirely new ideas that have never been thought or created?</description>

There are definitely way more ways to do this out there but I’d highlight some of the less frequently used visual programming platforms for your enjoyment.</description>

Hello friends,
I hope that you all have had another amazing week being creative.
A bunch of you have left feedback that you want to see more code; and so I have added a section called &amp;ldquo;Snippet of the Week&amp;rdquo; in which I will highlight shorter pieces of code that inspire me to further play with it and mutate it to being something else.</description>

The art of resting the mind and the power of dismissing from it all care and worry is probably one of the secrets of our great men. - Captain J. A. Hatfield
My apologies for not being able to put together a newsletter last week. There was so much going on in the week that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found the bandwidth to put it together and then needed a little R&amp;amp;D over the weekend.</description>

&amp;ldquo;scattered star-light falls a faint birdsong on the water&amp;rsquo;s surface&amp;rdquo; - Wayfinder
The poem was the generative haiku that was generated as I played through Wayfinder. What is it you ask?
Wayfinder is a web-based generative art game that takes the player on a contemplative cause-and-effect journey through nature. Symbolizing the give-and-take relationship humans have with the natural world, players move a mystical character through forest, grasslands and tundra in search of poetic tokens dotting the landscape.</description>

&amp;ldquo;A blank canvas&amp;hellip;has unlimited possibilities.&amp;rdquo; - Stephanie Perkins
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of time thinking about the question,
What does generative art looks like in the future? When reading through the hurdles that 60s technology (and earlier) was able to produce and I have to sit and ponder. With their limitations in processing, cost and storage, input constraints, technical abilities, one has to stop and think about what does pushing those bounds look like today.</description>

“All art is quite useless.” — but maybe useless is what we need right now. Oscar Wilde
Hello Friends!
This week has been a wonderful week full of interesting links and experimentation for myself and I hope that they were the same for you.
Below there is an article called &amp;ldquo;A CRITIQUE OF SURPRISE IN GENERATIVE ART&amp;rdquo; that has left interesting questions on the validity of generative art in light of artwork from the postmodern periods.</description>

      <description>Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep.&amp;quot; - Scott Adams
This last week I finished the book, &amp;ldquo;Your Joking Mr. Feynman&amp;rdquo; and I have to say that Feynman would have loved to work in the Generative Arts. (And by the way, this is a great listen (free w/ Audible subscription.) . A greatly influential scientist of the 20th century but not your lab rat; but one who would have done almost anything to experience.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.&amp;rdquo; - Maya Angelou
This week&amp;rsquo;s letter is a little delayed due to being on vacation and trying to get in as much beach time before the tropical storms come. But it is always empowering to listen to the ocean and the sound that it makes. I mean the very nature of chaos that it controls due to the power of the waves is astounding.</description>

      <description>“ Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light, and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. And don&amp;rsquo;t bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: Worry not where you take things from - it&amp;rsquo;s where you take them to.</description>

“Nothing&amp;rsquo;s perfect, the world&amp;rsquo;s not perfect. But it&amp;rsquo;s there for us, trying the best it can; that&amp;rsquo;s what makes it so beautiful.” - Hiromu Arakaw
The beauty of art is that it is experimental, its emotional, it&amp;rsquo;s spiritual and as an artist, it helps better understand who we are and why we are by expressing the inner self. It can be a medium of unity, it can be a cry for anarchy.</description>
