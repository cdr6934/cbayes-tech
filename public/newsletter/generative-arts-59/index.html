And this week’s rendition is Muriel Cooper (1924 - 1994)\nKnown best for her work in book design and engaging with digital art. Designer of the MIT Press Logo Although never learned to code, Muriel was central to teaching and help ready a new generation of creative coding practices such as John Maeda who continued to heavily influence the likes of Golan Levin and Casey Reas. Founder of the Visual Language Workshop (instrumental to exploring multimedia type in numerous mediums) Just to showcase some of her work…\nReferences:\nLooking Back on Muriel Cooper’s Vision of the Future Wikipedia Muriel Cooper’s Legacy For next week..\nWho are they?\n2D Fluid Simulation A 2D flu­id sim­u­la­tion us­ing the APIC (Af­fine Particle-in-Cell) meth­od. Com­pared to 3D Flu­id Sim­u­la­tion, the sim­u­la­tion is run­ning in a single thread.\nJust a fun simulation to play around with a bunch of technical documentation linked inside of it.\nIntroduction to Raytracing: A Simple Method for Creating 3D Images The first thing we need to produce an image is a two-dimensional surface (this surface must be of some area and cannot be a point). With this in mind, we can visualize a picture as a cut made through a pyramid whose apex is located at the center of our eye and whose height is parallel to our line of sight (remember, to see something, we must view along a line that connects the eye to that object). We will call this cut, or slice, mentioned before, the image plane (you can see this image plane as the canvas used by painters). An image plane is a computer graphics concept, and we will use it as a two-dimensional surface to project our three-dimensional scene. Although it may seem obvious, what we have just described is one of the most fundamental concepts used to create images on various apparatuses. For example, an equivalent in photography is the surface of the film (a sensor for a digital camera) or, as mentioned before, the canvas used by painters.\nArcadia Arcadia is a long-form generative art series hosted on Art Blocks. The algorithm for the artwork takes a “seed” value - a large combination of numbers and letters - and then uses that to compute shapes, colors, and scribbles for the final output. There is no human intervention when an output is generated; the art is created solely by a computer. With this generation method, the possible outputs are almost endless and no two outputs will look the same. The project was created using p5.js and WebGL.\nI found the writeup for this piece to really pick through the process and thoughts of the artist Zach Watson. You can find him on IG and his site.\n10 PRINT with SVG Yes, yet another 10 PRINT notebook! The ideas of that seminal program is a favorite among creative coders and everybody should check the book. If you don’t believe me, just type 10 print in the Search box above…\nthe breakout star of generative art Tyler Hobbs is arguably the poster boy of generative art and the most eloquent champion of code as a creative medium. A former software engineer with a side passion for (figurative) drawing and painting, he discovered the potential of abstract, algorithm-assisted art a decade ago and began writing relatively simple programs that could create multiple variants on a theme. Running, tweaking and repeatedly re-running these programs, Hobbs has developed a uniquely ‘painterly’ digital aesthetic rooted in non-digital ‘system’ art and Abstract Expressionism.\nI’m always very happy to see generative art continue to be part of the cultural conversation.\nOutburst Following is the profile site of おかず who has an entire blog filled with amazing tutorials around the work that he continues to do. Thanks to Makio135 for linking it in one of his many tutorials on Observable\n📚 Books Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age, 1952–1982 explores how the rise of computer technology, together with its emergence in popular consciousness, impacted the making of art in the age of the mainframe. International and interdisciplinary in scope, Coded examines the origins of what we now call digital art, featuring artists, writers, musicians, choreographers and filmmakers working directly with computers as well as those using algorithms and other systems to produce their work. Whether computer-generated or not, the many artworks considered here reflect the simultaneous wonder and alienation that was characteristic of the 1960s and ’70s, along with the utopian and dystopian possibilities of these new machines. Today, with digital technology fully integrated into our lives, Coded’s examination of the years leading up to the advent of the personal computer is relevant, even imperative, to fully appreciating art and culture in the computer age―both then and now.\nI do hope to make it to this exhibition at some point. Being that it is in LA, I don’t make it out there that often but it might be worth the trip across the

 and the most eloquent champion of code as a creative medium. A former software engineer with a side passion for (figurative) drawing and painting, he discovered the potential of abstract, algorithm-assisted art a decade ago and began writing relatively simple programs that could create multiple variants on a theme. Running, tweaking and repeatedly re-running these programs, Hobbs has developed a uniquely ‘painterly’ digital aesthetic rooted in non-digital &lsquo;system&rsquo; art and Abstract Expressionism.</p></blockquote><p>I’m always very happy to see generative art continue to be part of the cultural conversation.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=CleanShot_2023-02-03_at_23.33.51.png alt="CleanShot 2023-02-03 at 23.33.51.png"></p><h2 id=outbursthttpsnotecomoutburst><a href=https://note.com/outburst/>Outburst</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#outbursthttpsnotecomoutburst>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Following is the profile site of <strong><strong>おかず</strong></strong> who has an entire blog filled with amazing tutorials around the work that he continues to do.

International and interdisciplinary in scope, <em>Coded</em>
 examines the origins of what we now call digital art, featuring artists, writers, musicians, choreographers and filmmakers working directly with computers as well as those using algorithms and other systems to produce their work. Whether computer-generated or not, the many artworks considered here reflect the simultaneous wonder and alienation that was characteristic of the 1960s and ’70s, along with the utopian and dystopian possibilities of these new machines. Today, with digital technology fully integrated into our lives, <em>Coded</em>’s examination of the years leading up to the advent of the personal computer is relevant, even imperative, to fully appreciating art and culture in the computer age―both then and now.</p></blockquote><p>I do hope to make it to this exhibition at some point. Being that it is in LA, I don’t make it out there that often but it might be worth the trip across the country.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://generativecollective.com/tags/generative/>generative</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://generativecollective.com/newsletter/generative-arts-60/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Prophetic Art, ChatGPT Inside and Out, and The History of Shadows</span></a>
