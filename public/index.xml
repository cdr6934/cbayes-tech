      <description>The following post provides some context around the many many different technologies that are currently out there in the blockchain space. Much of these are changing on a monthly basis with new things coming out all the time. So I thought it might be good to have a document that tries to compile what this landscape currently looks like in 2022.

      <description>Following are 10 ways how to start learning how to make generative art.
Learn how to use a framework or software for generative art. There are a number of different ways to do this. Here is a mindmap as a guide. I&amp;rsquo;d suggest just looking at them and start searching for them.
Take a few art classes There are plenty of places online such as Domestika or Skillshare that will help you find inspiration, and open your mind to new ideas of expression.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with creating blocks or rectangles with various color gradients using the pixelated variations. It is by far a most satisfying when you can then take it and use sin waves to give the edges a little more interesting flow.</description>

      <description>The following project spanned across 800 editions that were released on FXHash in Dec 2021. Conceptually, this was a meditation on scale and collision. Scale is intuitively misunderstood by humans. We have a poor judgement how big, or how small things really are as we do not have a reference of comparison.
It may be due to the fact that these scales are recent discoveries.
We have seen stars for millenium, but we have not had a good understanding at their size until&amp;hellip; The same goes for really small items.</description>

      <description>The following generative piece emphasizes a set of 9 illusions all telling a different story. In history, 9 has been signified as a number of divine completeness. However completeness is usually clean and luxuriant, here the image contrasts the everyday messiness of life. Each element of 9 tells a familiar but different story. Can you find yours?</description>

      <description>Its at the end of summer and it brings happiness to all! When looking closer every shape is made up of small ovals that are layered in a very specific pattern. Some of the ovals are spread out more, others are different shades, transparent and variations of each color.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Creativity is a synthesis of two qualities: imagination and concreteness.&amp;rdquo; - Pearl Zhu
As NFTs are all the rage, I thought I might lay out my thoughts and maybe inspire more conversation and thoughts. So I&amp;rsquo;ve intended this to be considered in small chunks.
I love the fact that the non-centralized infrastructure brings transparency to the masses. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea that we could be speeding up the process of CO2 shot into the environment due to additional electrical consumption of the blockchains.</description>

Another week has come and gone.
I am currently working on an essay trying to historically outline the world of generative art since the 1960s. I&amp;rsquo;d like to really trace the thread back to compile a little history just because I love origin stories and I also highlight our &amp;ldquo;ancestors&amp;rdquo; of the generative arts.</description>

“A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art.&amp;quot; ― Paul Cezanne
One of the things that I hope we continue to remember as &amp;ldquo;autonomous art&amp;rdquo; (i.e. currently GANs and generative artistic systems) becomes more apparent in the coming decade. Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget what makes art and the aesthetic beautiful. the process and the relationship one has with a piece of art.</description>

&amp;ldquo;If little else, the brain is an educational toy.&amp;rdquo; - Tom Robbins
Well, there is about 6 hours worth of learnable content that I&amp;rsquo;ve attached this week. Most of it I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to race through.
Tyler Hobbs Interview Being the first interview I&amp;rsquo;ve done this way. I am a little overwhelmed and self conscience but I decided that the beauty of generative is that sometimes the mistakes are just part of the output and should be kept.</description>

R and Generative Art How do you like to see tools used for different things?
I enjoy seeing a tool used for something entirely different.
Take Excel, for example, it is a complicated calculator with a bunch of functions used for managing portfolios, budgeting, forecasting, to personal databases as the normal use case of Excel.</description>

Happy Weekend Friends!
Its been a week. The people of the United States have much to consider for the future. It&amp;rsquo;s only through thoughtful debate and understanding on all sides in which we need to hash out our differences with patience, respect, kindness and vulnerability.
Otherwise it is our animalistic nature that will take its course.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Create with the heart; build with the mind.&amp;rdquo; - Criss Jami
Good Morning!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering, &amp;ldquo;What is creativity and where does it come from?&amp;rdquo; Are we wired with certain default, &amp;ldquo;inspirations&amp;rdquo; of ideas that generate the corpus we have come up with today? I think of Carl Jung&amp;rsquo;s story archetypes and it would seem that there is evidence for a collective conscience.
Yet, we still need to ask, are there entirely new ideas that have never been thought or created?</description>

I have to say that this is going out a little later than usual but I think you will find some of the articles today to be much more in the details around simplex noise and the like but not all.</description>

The soul of art is depicted in the quote so well. Art is&amp;hellip; a little hard to pin down with words but it isn&amp;rsquo;t just simply the act of transcribing from the physical world to paper.
So what is it?
We do know it is important to us. We dedicate entire buildings to the collection of art, we have art stores, art classes, and even entire markets that deal in it.</description>

Good morning friends,
We are but a couple weeks away from Christmas having officially rung the bells of another Christmas season. Albeit, it is far from the traditional in store experiences of long lines snaking through the store and popping out at the seams. This year, across the globe our store fronts have transitioned to the internet. And there are some great advantages of it.</description>

Here in the US, we just celebrated Thanksgiving Day, but with this unfortunate year; many of us have not been able to see our family due to restrictions, lock downs, etc. Yet there are always things that we can be thankful. For me is technology, programming languages and the ability to create using them and have done alot more this year than I have done in previously.</description>

Hello friends,
I hope that you all have had another amazing week being creative.
A bunch of you have left feedback that you want to see more code; and so I have added a section called &amp;ldquo;Snippet of the Week&amp;rdquo; in which I will highlight shorter pieces of code that inspire me to further play with it and mutate it to being something else.</description>

Hello Friends!
This week has been a wonderful week full of interesting links and experimentation for myself and I hope that they were the same for you.
Below there is an article called &amp;ldquo;A CRITIQUE OF SURPRISE IN GENERATIVE ART&amp;rdquo; that has left interesting questions on the validity of generative art in light of artwork from the postmodern periods.</description>

This week&amp;rsquo;s letter is a little delayed due to being on vacation and trying to get in as much beach time before the tropical storms come. But it is always empowering to listen to the ocean and the sound that it makes. I mean the very nature of chaos that it controls due to the power of the waves is astounding.</description>

      <description>library(stringr) library(readr) library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) I have been curious on what makes an interesting post on instagram based on a larger dataset of images that have been tagged with #generativeart. Some of this is just data discovery, this could seem that there may be a correlation between the tags that have been used and the amount of likes there are.
# Extract hashtags patt &amp;lt;- regex(&amp;#34;#\\S+&amp;#34;) genart &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;#34;~/InstaCrawlR/table-generativeart-2020-10-11 13:35:33.csv&amp;#34;) genart_db &amp;lt;- genart %&amp;gt;% select(ID, Likes, Owner, Date, Text) %&amp;gt;% mutate(hashtags = str_extract_all(Text,patt) ) genart_db_table &amp;lt;- genart_db %&amp;gt;% unnest(cols = &amp;#34;hashtags&amp;#34;) %&amp;gt;% mutate(Year = year(Date), Month = month(Date), DayOfWeek = wday(Date), Day = day(Date), Hour = hour(Date)) genart_db_table %&amp;gt;% head() That will generate a rather large dataset</description>

Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. And don&amp;rsquo;t bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: Worry not where you take things from - it&amp;rsquo;s where you take them to.</description>

The beauty of art is that it is experimental, its emotional, it&amp;rsquo;s spiritual and as an artist, it helps better understand who we are and why we are by expressing the inner self. It can be a medium of unity, it can be a cry for anarchy.</description>

Due to these nefarious acts; it is in the best interest of any organization to ensure the work of most customers. Thus it is appropriate to respond to this fraud.</description>

Using the scales package Using the scales packages from Hadley, there is a great function with various options including passing a vector.
library(scales) dollar_format()(c(-100, 0.23, 1.456565, 2e3)) Formatting currency with separator Following is a simple function one can build and place in their utility function that will give formatted currency.</description>

But it does take discipline and instinct to understand the validity of the data so lets exercise this a little:</description>

      <description>Sometimes, seeing data in a 3 dimensional space gives us better visibility to the rest of the world. You will see that we have taken a hypothetical experiment and tried to rate different ideas by their complexity and likelihood to succeed.

      <description>Threw error due to the API In the past, the best way to get stock prices was to use either Google Finance or Yahoo Finance data streams. These have since become difficult to keep up to date and thus another outlet to get this information is AlphaVantager. Following is a simple R implementation to get up to date data. You will be able to thus use this to find the information.</description>

      <description>Just like any skill, there is a learning curve involved in creating effective communication. This involves the code written and the documentation of its usage. Writing functional code is a intricate thing to accomplish as a newbie. It takes time to know what is efficient and how to communicate it as such. Now, writing functional documentation is more complicated as there is a delicate balance between not reguritate what the code says, and giving usable pointers to the users on how a particular function was intended to be used.</description>

      <description>Believing that something is crap, is creative indigestion. It inhibits your power to create, sucks your soul&amp;rsquo;s happiness and breeds stress and rejection. It becomes a waste of time, rather than further develop. We discontinue this crap that we have mistaken as no creativity. This is a perception that needs to be overcome and dealt with. But how do you overcome?
Don&amp;rsquo;t Limit your Creativity As people we generally want to be like the Jones.</description>
