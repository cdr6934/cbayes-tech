      <description>The following post provides some context around the many many different technologies that are currently out there in the blockchain space. Much of these are changing on a monthly basis with new things coming out all the time. So I thought it might be good to have a document that tries to compile what this landscape currently looks like in 2022.

Learn how to use a framework or software for generative art. There are a number of different ways to do this. Here is a mindmap as a guide. I&amp;rsquo;d suggest just looking at them and start searching for them.
Take a few artÂ classes There are plenty of places online such as Domestika or Skillshare that will help you find inspiration, and open your mind to new ideas of expression.</description>

      <description>library(stringr) library(readr) library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) I have been curious on what makes an interesting post on instagram based on a larger dataset of images that have been tagged with #generativeart. Some of this is just data discovery, this could seem that there may be a correlation between the tags that have been used and the amount of likes there are.
# Extract hashtags patt &amp;lt;- regex(&amp;#34;#\\S+&amp;#34;) genart &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;#34;~/InstaCrawlR/table-generativeart-2020-10-11 13:35:33.csv&amp;#34;) genart_db &amp;lt;- genart %&amp;gt;% select(ID, Likes, Owner, Date, Text) %&amp;gt;% mutate(hashtags = str_extract_all(Text,patt) ) genart_db_table &amp;lt;- genart_db %&amp;gt;% unnest(cols = &amp;#34;hashtags&amp;#34;) %&amp;gt;% mutate(Year = year(Date), Month = month(Date), DayOfWeek = wday(Date), Day = day(Date), Hour = hour(Date)) genart_db_table %&amp;gt;% head() That will generate a rather large dataset</description>

      <description>Fraud continues to be an important topic in the financial world helping detect when funds are mismanaged.
Nilson reports that U.S. card fraud (credit, debt, etc) was reportedly $9 billion in 2016 and expected to increase to $12 billion by 2020. Due to these nefarious acts; it is in the best interest of any organization to ensure the work of most customers. Thus it is appropriate to respond to this fraud.</description>

Using the scales package Using the scales packages from Hadley, there is a great function with various options including passing a vector.

      <description>One of the fundamental priorities of a data scientist is being able to bend the data into a format that is plyable. Being able to effectively use tidyr, reshape2 and the core functions are key to success in being able to manage a large dataset without swimming or drowning in it.
But it does take discipline and instinct to understand the validity of the data so lets exercise this a little:</description>

      <description>Threw error due to the API In the past, the best way to get stock prices was to use either Google Finance or Yahoo Finance data streams. These have since become difficult to keep up to date and thus another outlet to get this information is AlphaVantager. Following is a simple R implementation to get up to date data. You will be able to thus use this to find the information.</description>

      <description>IN PROGRESS Text Generation (Generative Texr) is a very interesting field of study. There are a number of different packages that help generate the lists of words to give the user a better understanding of the technology.
Tracery The following Node library gives a structure which is used to generate random words that are assigned to lexical structure that is defined by the user.

      <description>Tips on Feature Engineering to fit how classifiers work; giving a geometry problem to a tree, oversized dimension to a kNN and interval data to an SVM are not a good ideas remove as much nonlinearities as possible; expecting that some classifier will do Fourier analysis inside is rather naive (even if, it will waste a lot of complexity there) make features generic to all objects so that some sampling in the chain won&amp;rsquo;t knock them out check previous works &amp;ndash; often transformation used for visualisation or testing similar types of data is already tuned to uncover interesting aspects avoid unstable, optimizing transformations like PCA which may lead to overfitting experiment a lot </description>

      <description>Just like any skill, there is a learning curve involved in creating effective communication. This involves the code written and the documentation of its usage. Writing functional code is a intricate thing to accomplish as a newbie. It takes time to know what is efficient and how to communicate it as such. Now, writing functional documentation is more complicated as there is a delicate balance between not reguritate what the code says, and giving usable pointers to the users on how a particular function was intended to be used.</description>

      <description>Believing that something is crap, is creative indigestion. It inhibits your power to create, sucks your soul&amp;rsquo;s happiness and breeds stress and rejection. It becomes a waste of time, rather than further develop. We discontinue this crap that we have mistaken as no creativity. This is a perception that needs to be overcome and dealt with. But how do you overcome?
Don&amp;rsquo;t Limit your Creativity As people we generally want to be like the Jones.</description>
