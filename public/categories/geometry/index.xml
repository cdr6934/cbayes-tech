I felt as though it might be good to rewrite and also include some of the information that is part of the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This note describes the technique and gives the solution to finding the shortest distance from a point to a line or line segment. The equation of a line defined through two points \(P_1\) \((x1,y1)\) and \(P_2\) \((x2,y2)\) is&lt;/p&gt;</description>
