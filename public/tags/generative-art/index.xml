      <description>Following are 10 ways how to start learning how to make generative art.
Learn how to use a framework or software for generative art. There are a number of different ways to do this. Here is a mindmap as a guide. I&amp;rsquo;d suggest just looking at them and start searching for them.
Take a few artÂ classes There are plenty of places online such as Domestika or Skillshare that will help you find inspiration, and open your mind to new ideas of expression.</description>

      <description>The following project spanned across 800 editions that were released on FXHash in Dec 2021. Conceptually, this was a meditation on scale and collision. Scale is intuitively misunderstood by humans. We have a poor judgement how big, or how small things really are as we do not have a reference of comparison.
It may be due to the fact that these scales are recent discoveries.
We have seen stars for millenium, but we have not had a good understanding at their size until&amp;hellip; The same goes for really small items.</description>

      <description>The following generative piece appears like the robe of an emperor. When looking closely, you will find that each square is unique as it builds a web of fabric. You can find the pieces on Objkt</description>
