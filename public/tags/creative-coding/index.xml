It may be due to the fact that these scales are recent discoveries.
We have seen stars for millenium, but we have not had a good understanding at their size until&amp;hellip; The same goes for really small items.</description>

      <description>The following generative piece appears like the robe of an emperor. When looking closely, you will find that each square is unique as it builds a web of fabric. You can find the pieces on Objkt</description>
