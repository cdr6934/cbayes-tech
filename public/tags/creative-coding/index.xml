      <description>The following project spanned across 800 editions that were released on FXHash in Dec 2021. Conceptually, this was a meditation on scale and collision. Scale is intuitively misunderstood by humans. We have a poor judgement how big, or how small things really are as we do not have a reference of comparison.
It may be due to the fact that these scales are recent discoveries.
We have seen stars for millenium, but we have not had a good understanding at their size until&amp;hellip; The same goes for really small items.</description>
