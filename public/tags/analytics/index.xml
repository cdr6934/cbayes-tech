      <description>library(stringr) library(readr) library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) I have been curious on what makes an interesting post on instagram based on a larger dataset of images that have been tagged with #generativeart. Some of this is just data discovery, this could seem that there may be a correlation between the tags that have been used and the amount of likes there are.
# Extract hashtags patt &amp;lt;- regex(&amp;#34;#\\S+&amp;#34;) genart &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;#34;~/InstaCrawlR/table-generativeart-2020-10-11 13:35:33.csv&amp;#34;) genart_db &amp;lt;- genart %&amp;gt;% select(ID, Likes, Owner, Date, Text) %&amp;gt;% mutate(hashtags = str_extract_all(Text,patt) ) genart_db_table &amp;lt;- genart_db %&amp;gt;% unnest(cols = &amp;#34;hashtags&amp;#34;) %&amp;gt;% mutate(Year = year(Date), Month = month(Date), DayOfWeek = wday(Date), Day = day(Date), Hour = hour(Date)) genart_db_table %&amp;gt;% head() That will generate a rather large dataset</description>

      <description>Fraud continues to be an important topic in the financial world helping detect when funds are mismanaged.
Nilson reports that U.S. card fraud (credit, debt, etc) was reportedly $9 billion in 2016 and expected to increase to $12 billion by 2020. Due to these nefarious acts; it is in the best interest of any organization to ensure the work of most customers. Thus it is appropriate to respond to this fraud.</description>
