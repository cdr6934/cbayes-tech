      <description>&lt;p&gt;Believing that something is crap, is creative indigestion. It inhibits your power to create, sucks your soul&amp;rsquo;s happiness and breeds stress and rejection. It becomes a waste of time, rather than further develop. We discontinue this crap that we have mistaken as no creativity. This is a perception that needs to be overcome and dealt with. But how do you overcome?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-limit-your-creativity&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Limit your Creativity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As people we generally want to be like the Jones. This is inherent; we deem it necessary to survive in the vivacious world of competition. But,&#xA;Competition should drive us, rather than control us.&#xA;For keeping up will limit us to their best. And limits to creativity should never keep us from trying to create and letting our minds be wild. Honestly our best should be our passion to want to develop. A passion to push the envelope and find new ways of defining and redefining what we create.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
